# System Architecture

## Backend Framework
- **Flask**: Core web framework with SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- **Database**: SQLite (default) with support for PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for session management with user roles (admin/regular users)
- **Forms**: Flask-WTF for form handling and validation with file upload support

## Database Design
- **User Model**: Handles authentication, roles (admin/regular), and user relationships
- **AcquisitionRequest Model**: Central entity for purchase requests with status workflow
- **Attachment Model**: File storage metadata linked to requests
- **StatusChange Model**: Audit trail for request status modifications

## Status Workflow
The system implements a four-stage procurement workflow:
1. **Or√ßamento** (Budget) - Initial request with budget collection
2. **Fase de Compra** (Purchase Phase) - Approved for purchasing
3. **A Caminho** (On the Way) - Items shipped/in transit
4. **Finalizado** (Completed) - Request fulfilled

## File Management
- Upload directory: `uploads/` with 16MB file size limit
- Supported formats: PDF, Word documents, Excel files, and images
- Secure filename generation with conflict prevention
- File metadata stored in database with original filenames

## User Interface
- Bootstrap-based responsive design with dark theme
- Portuguese language interface
- Role-based navigation and feature access
- Real-time form validation and file upload feedback

## Security Features
- Password hashing with Werkzeug security utilities
- Session management with configurable secret keys
- File upload validation and secure filename handling
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- Administrator-only request deletion with confirmation dialogs

## PDF Reporting System
- Individual request PDF generation with complete details, attachments list, and status history
- General system report with statistics, status distribution, and complete request listing
- Professional formatting with proper page layouts and no overlapping content
- Secure download functionality integrated throughout the interface

## Sample Data
- Pre-populated with demonstration users (Ariane Santos, Edilson Costa, Edson Oliveira)
- Example acquisition requests covering various categories (office supplies, IT equipment, cleaning materials, textbooks, sports equipment)
- Complete status transition history showing realistic workflow progression
- Sample data demonstrates all system features and status workflows
